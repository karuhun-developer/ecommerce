## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `folio-routing` — Creates file-based routes with Laravel Folio. Activates when creating new pages, setting up routes, working with route parameters or model binding, adding middleware to pages, working with resources/views/pages; or when the user mentions Folio, pages, file-based routing, page routes, or creating a new page for a URL path.
- `fortify-development` — ACTIVATE when the user works on authentication in Laravel. This includes login, registration, password reset, email verification, two-factor authentication (2FA/TOTP/QR codes/recovery codes), profile updates, password confirmation, or any auth-related routes and controllers. Activate when the user mentions Fortify, auth, authentication, login, register, signup, forgot password, verify email, 2FA, or references app/Actions/Fortify/, CreateNewUser, UpdateUserProfileInformation, FortifyServiceProvider, config/fortify.php, or auth guards. Fortify is the frontend-agnostic authentication backend for Laravel that registers all auth routes and controllers. Also activate when building SPA or headless authentication, customizing login redirects, overriding response contracts like LoginResponse, or configuring login throttling. Do NOT activate for Laravel Passport (OAuth2 API tokens), Socialite (OAuth social login), or non-auth Laravel features.
- `laravel-best-practices` — Apply this skill whenever writing, reviewing, or refactoring Laravel PHP code. This includes creating or modifying controllers, models, migrations, form requests, policies, jobs, scheduled commands, service classes, and Eloquent queries. Triggers for N+1 and query performance issues, caching strategies, authorization and security patterns, validation, error handling, queue and job configuration, route definitions, and architectural decisions. Also use for Laravel code reviews and refactoring existing Laravel code to follow best practices. Covers any task involving Laravel backend PHP code patterns.
- `pulse-development` — Handles Laravel Pulse setup, configuration, and custom card development. Activates when installing Pulse; configuring the dashboard or authorization gate; setting up recorders and filtering; building custom Livewire cards; optimizing with Redis ingest or sampling; or when the user mentions /pulse, pulse:check, pulse:work, Pulse::record(), or application monitoring.
- `fluxui-development` — Use this skill for Flux UI development in Livewire applications only. Trigger when working with <flux:*> components, building or customizing Livewire component UIs, creating forms, modals, tables, or other interactive elements. Covers: flux: components (buttons, inputs, modals, forms, tables, date-pickers, kanban, badges, tooltips, etc.), component composition, Tailwind CSS styling, Heroicons/Lucide icon integration, validation patterns, responsive design, and theming. Do not use for non-Livewire frameworks or non-component styling.
- `livewire-development` — Use for any task or question involving Livewire. Activate if user mentions Livewire, wire: directives, or Livewire-specific concepts like wire:model, wire:click, wire:sort, or islands, invoke this skill. Covers building new components, debugging reactivity issues, real-time form validation, drag-and-drop, loading states, migrating from Livewire 3 to 4, converting component formats (SFC/MFC/class-based), and performance optimization. Do not use for non-Livewire reactive UI (React, Vue, Alpine-only, Inertia.js) or standard Laravel forms without Livewire.
- `pest-testing` — Use this skill for Pest PHP testing in Laravel projects only. Trigger whenever any test is being written, edited, fixed, or refactored — including fixing tests that broke after a code change, adding assertions, converting PHPUnit to Pest, adding datasets, and TDD workflows. Always activate when the user asks how to write something in Pest, mentions test files or directories (tests/Feature, tests/Unit, tests/Browser), or needs browser testing, smoke testing multiple pages for JS errors, or architecture tests. Covers: test()/it()/expect() syntax, datasets, mocking, browser testing (visit/click/fill), smoke testing, arch(), Livewire component tests, RefreshDatabase, and all Pest 4 features. Do not use for factories, seeders, migrations, controllers, models, or non-test PHP code.
- `tailwindcss-development` — Always invoke when the user's message includes 'tailwind' in any form. Also invoke for: building responsive grid layouts (multi-column card grids, product grids), flex/grid page structures (dashboards with sidebars, fixed topbars, mobile-toggle navs), styling UI components (cards, tables, navbars, pricing sections, forms, inputs, badges), adding dark mode variants, fixing spacing or typography, and Tailwind v3/v4 work. The core use case: writing or fixing Tailwind utility classes in HTML templates (Blade, JSX, Vue). Skip for backend PHP logic, database queries, API routes, JavaScript with no HTML/CSS component, CSS file audits, build tool configuration, and vanilla CSS.
- `blaze-optimize` — Set up and optimize Blade component rendering with Blaze. Use when installing Blaze, optimizing components, or configuring @blaze directives and strategies.
- `medialibrary-development` — Build and work with spatie/laravel-medialibrary features including associating files with Eloquent models, defining media collections and conversions, generating responsive images, and retrieving media URLs and paths.
- `debug-using-debugbar` — Use this skill to optimize requests or debug Laravel application issues — slow pages, N+1 queries, exceptions, failed requests, or unexpected behavior — by inspecting data captured by Laravel Debugbar via Artisan CLI commands. Use when the user asks to investigate a bug, diagnose a slow request, find duplicate queries, check what happened on a previous request, or optimize database performance, even if they don't explicitly mention "debugbar" or "profiling."

- `tweakflux-theme-generator` — Generate TweakFlux themes for Flux UI from descriptions, color palettes, screenshots, or brand guidelines.
- `caveman` — Ultra-compressed communication mode. Cuts token usage ~75% by speaking like caveman while keeping full technical accuracy. Supports intensity levels: lite, full (default), ultra, wenyan-lite, wenyan-full, wenyan-ultra. Use when user says "caveman mode", "talk like caveman", "use caveman", "less tokens", "be brief", or invokes /caveman. Also auto-triggers when token efficiency is requested.
- `caveman-commit` — Ultra-compressed commit message generator. Cuts noise from commit messages while preserving intent and reasoning. Conventional Commits format. Subject ≤50 chars, body only when "why" isn't obvious. Use when user says "write a commit", "commit message", "generate commit", "/commit", or invokes /caveman-commit. Auto-triggers when staging changes.
- `caveman-compress` — Compress natural language memory files (CLAUDE.md, todos, preferences) into caveman format to save input tokens. Preserves all technical substance, code, URLs, and structure. Compressed version overwrites the original file. Human-readable backup saved as FILE.original.md. Trigger: /caveman:compress <filepath> or "compress memory file"
- `caveman-help` — Quick-reference card for all caveman modes, skills, and commands. One-shot display, not a persistent mode. Trigger: /caveman-help, "caveman help", "what caveman commands", "how do I use caveman".
- `caveman-review` — Ultra-compressed code review comments. Cuts noise from PR feedback while preserving the actionable signal. Each comment is one line: location, problem, fix. Use when user says "review this PR", "code review", "review the diff", "/review", or invokes /caveman-review. Auto-triggers when reviewing pull requests.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `yarn run build`, `yarn run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.
- To check environment variables, read the `.env` file directly.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== folio/core rules ===

# Laravel Folio

- Laravel Folio is a powerful page-based router that simplifies routing in Laravel applications.
- Routes are generated automatically by creating Blade templates in `resources/views/pages`.
- IMPORTANT: Activate 'folio-routing' when working with Folio, pages, routes, route parameters, model binding, middleware, or `resources/views/pages`.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `yarn run build` or ask the user to run `yarn run dev` or `composer run dev`.

## Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allow to build dynamic, reactive interfaces in PHP without writing JavaScript.
- You can use Alpine.js for client-side interactions instead of JavaScript frameworks.
- Keep state server-side so the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions as you would in HTTP requests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== spatie/laravel-medialibrary rules ===

## Media Library

- `spatie/laravel-medialibrary` associates files with Eloquent models, with support for collections, conversions, and responsive images.
- Always activate the `medialibrary-development` skill when working with media uploads, conversions, collections, responsive images, or any code that uses the `HasMedia` interface or `InteractsWithMedia` trait.

=== joshcirre/tweakflux rules ===

# TweakFlux

This application uses the TweakFlux package (`joshcirre/tweakflux`) for deep theming of Flux UI components via Tailwind v4 CSS custom properties.

Activate the `tweakflux-theme-generator` skill when the user asks to create, generate, edit, or modify a TweakFlux theme — whether from a description, color palette, screenshot, brand guidelines, or any visual reference.

## Available Commands

- `tweakflux apply {theme?}` — Apply a theme (interactive picker if no name given)
- `tweakflux apply {theme} --no-effects` — Apply a theme without visual effects (glows, animations)
- `tweakflux list` — List all available themes
- `tweakflux create {name}` — Scaffold a new theme JSON file
- `tweakflux boost` — Copy Boost guidelines and skills into your project

## Theme Files

Themes are JSON files in `resources/themes/{slug}.json`. All colors use `oklch(L C H)` format. Set any value to `null` to keep the Flux default.

- `css` — Structural CSS always included (layout overrides, button shapes).
- `effects` — Toggleable visual effects (glows, animations) that users can disable with `--no-effects`.
